These last days I talked with some people to run a special edition of [CSS SP](https://github.com/raphaelfabeni/css-sp). I like a lot of this project and It demands a special care! So, let's wait and see! Really excited about things we are doing at Red Ventures. I like to say you have to like your job and mainly your team because you will spend most the time of your day with them.
