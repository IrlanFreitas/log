Something I was thinking other day is about the true concept of humility. For me, one of its aspects is related to the idea of no matter how you are a _senior/ninja/master putYorJobPositionHere_, there is always space for you learn new stuff with people.

## :octocat: JS

`const` is amazing! I can avoid something change my dear variables! _BAAAAAAM!_ `const` does no grant immutability. 

```js
const myName = "Zell";
myName = "Triceratops";
// ERROR
```

```js
const egg = { name: "Humpty Dumpty" };
egg.isBroken = false;

console.log(egg);
// {
//   name: "Humpty Dumpty",
//   isBroken: false
// }
```
