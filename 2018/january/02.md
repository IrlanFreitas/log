Today I talked with some friends about project management softwares. I really like JIRA because it has a lot of features and integrations but probably if you start adding a lot of users, your bill will be expensive and if don't need something robust, you can use a simpler one. Another option is Asana, I just worked once with it, but it seems really cool. What I think, you can choose any software, since your project is organized and documented.

## :octocat: JS - React

Some days ago I learned how to create dynamic fields using _react-redux-form_. If we can add fields we can remove them, right? We can do it using:

```js
dispatch(actions.remove('user.phones', 2));

// Doing that, you are going to remove the index "2" 
// in the "user.phones" model
```
