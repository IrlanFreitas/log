These days I read some articles about job positions in web development and how we can divide our profession into so many different levels. And this is amazing! I have a WhatsApp group with some friends from college and it's so cool that every person is working with something different.

## :octocat: JS - React

If you work with React, then probably you've already heard about _recompose_. It's awesome! Check it, when you have time. So, it's common for complexs`components` or `containers` you get a long file. And _boooom_! You could `compose` inside other `compose`.

```js
// File 1
import { compose, withHandlers, withState } from 'recompose'

export default compose(
	withState('fabeniIsCool', 'setFabeniCool', true),
	withHandlers({
		// ...
	})
)
```

```js
import { compose, lifecycle } from 'recompose'

import FabeniCompose from './FabeniCompose'

export default compose(
	FabeniCompose,
	componentDidMount() {
		// ...
	}
)
```
