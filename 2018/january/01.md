These last days have been of adaptation. From Bahia directly to the Red Ventures office. It's a huge change, mainly about temperature. 

Talking about job: Last year our RV FED team did **a lot** of nice stuff and I'm sure this year will be awesome!

## :octocat: JS - React

Adding dynamic fields using _react-redux-form_.

```jsx
// Assuming you have a 'user' modelReducer in your store,
// with an initial state of .phones = []

import { Field, actions } from 'react-redux-form';

// inside the render() method of your React component:

render() {
  const { user, dispatch }  = this.props;

  return (
    <div>
      { user.phones.map((phone, i) =>
        <Field model={`user.phones[${i}]`} key={i}>
          <input type="text" />
        </Field>
      }
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(actions.push('user.phones', ''))}>
        Add phone
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
